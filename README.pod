=head1 NAME

Tie::Array::CSV - A tied array which combines the power of Tie::File and Text::CSV

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use strict; use warnings;
 use Tie::Array::CSV;
 tie my @file, 'Tie::Array::CSV', 'filename';

 print $file[0][2];
 $file[3][5] = "Camel";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module allows an array to be tied to a CSV file for reading and writing. The array is a standard Perl 2D array (i.e. an array of array references) which gives access to the row and column of the user's choosing. This is done using the well established modules L<Tie::File> which gives the arbitrary line access, and L<Text::CSV> for row parsing and updating.

This module was inspired by L<Tie::CSV_File> which (sadly) hasn't been maintained. It also doesn't attempt to do any of the parsing (as that module did), but rather passes all of the heavy lifting to other modules.

=head1 OPTIONS

As with any tied array, the construction uses the C<tie> function. C<tie my @file, 'Tie::Array::CSV', 'filename'> would tie the lexically scope array C<@file> to the file C<filename> using this module. Following these three arguements to <tie>, one may optionally pass a hashref containing additional configuration. Currently the only options are "pass-through" options, sent to the constructors of the different modules used internally, read more about them in those module's documentation.

=over

=item *

tie_file - hashref of options which are passed to the L<Tie::File> constructor

=item *

text_csv - hashref of options which are passed to the L<Text::CSV> constructor

=head1 CAVEATS

Much of the functionality of normal arrays is mimicked using L<Tie::Array>. The interaction of this with L<Tie::File> should be mentioned in that certain actions may be very inefficient. For example, C<(un)shift>-ing the first row of data will probably involve L<Tie::Array> asking L<Tie::File> to move each row up one line, one-by-one. As a note, the intra-row C<(un)shift> does not suffer this problem.
